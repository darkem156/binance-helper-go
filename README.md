# Binance Helper Go
This is a small module created to have an easy way to use the functionalities of the Binance API. The focus on the development is the Futures Trading, but eventually I will add more helpers and features for all the other environment. The objective of this project is to have a good alternative of the project "binance-futures-connector-python", but using Golang.
## Any help, comment, pull request, issue or advice is very welcome :)
